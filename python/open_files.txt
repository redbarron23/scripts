f = open('somefile.txt','r')
for line in f.readlines():
    print line
f.close()

# ...and...

f = open('somefile.txt','r')
for line in f.read().split('\n'):
    print line
f.close()
The xreadlines() function should be used for big files:

f = open('HUGE.log','r'):
for line in f.xreadlines():
   print line
f.close()

<open file 'declaration.txt', mode 'r' at 0x10c1b95d0>
>>> f.name
'declaration.txt'

>>> f.read()

>>> f.readline()
'When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve\n'
>>> f.readline()
'the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the\n'
